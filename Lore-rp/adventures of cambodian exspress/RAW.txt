"Ah, madam, hello"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:10 PM
"eh you want it like that?" she says to herself while she violent shoves the handle of the mop into the hole(edited)
YellowMiner (President Tungsten)Last Wednesday at 11:10 PM
"TUNK"
a bunch of startled operators
Sofia I Blomqvist av SvejårlandLast Wednesday at 11:11 PM
Sofia turns around to the captain relieved. She mubles somethimg to herself before talking. "Hello, muss Radcliff. I came here to ask you something."
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:11 PM
"ah told you to come out" she says with figor(edited)

Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:12 PM
"What would you like to know, Sofia"
"Also, Alicia, get this nonsense sorted out"
"I hope we don't have any rats onboard"(edited)
Sofia I Blomqvist av SvejårlandLast Wednesday at 11:13 PM
"Uhm... May I know about all the people from Audelin or working for them?" She says this a little nervous knowimg it might be a little suspicious.
Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:13 PM
"Uh"
"The Pianist is from Audelin, I hear"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:14 PM
she stares hoping it comes out "that could be... rats with machines!" she ponders "but worms would be nice though" she trails off
Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:14 PM
"Maloy, talented fellow"
"You can recognise him by his feather"
Sofia I Blomqvist av SvejårlandLast Wednesday at 11:15 PM
She nods.
Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:15 PM
"Our oeunologist is also from Audelin"
"Cotton Beaumont"
"Don't let the name deceive you, he is a mountain of a man"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:15 PM
she turns away from the hole and waits for the captain to finish(edited)
Sofia I Blomqvist av SvejårlandLast Wednesday at 11:15 PM
She starts making mental notes of the conversation. This will be important.
Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:15 PM
"But he has the tongue of a critic"
"Or of a born traveller"
"Depends who you ask"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:16 PM
"intimidating serious fellow, that one" she comments softly(edited)
Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:16 PM
"He is"
"Never saw him become violent"
Sofia I Blomqvist av SvejårlandLast Wednesday at 11:16 PM
"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:16 PM
"Some people are just that scary"
"I don't think he'd hurt a fly, though"
"Now, this isn't true of everyone in the crew..."

"oh cap'n did you sort the scuffle or...?" she looks back and tilts her head(edited)
Sofia I Blomqvist av SvejårlandLast Wednesday at 11:18 PM
"Well thank you I will talk to them."

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:21 PM
"ah, captain before you go again... a machine made a hole there" she points at the hole wussul made "i'm guessing tiny creatures, worms, rats or maybe fey... i don't really know but it looked like it had a drill"(edited)
she casually comments finding it all amusing that such things were in the world
Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:28 PM
"A machine?"
She looks worried
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:30 PM
she nods proud "it had a drill and was flying, ᵢ ₜₕᵢₙₖ, and it made confused movements" she thinks a little harder "it made me think tiny smart people, ᵒʳ ᵐᵃʸᵇᵉ ʷᵒᵒᵈʷᵒʳᵐˢ  , were driving it"(edited)
as always Alicia is Alicia
Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:33 PM
"Fine"
"Go out, we need to announce to the guests that dinner is ready"
"Can you handle that?"
"This ship, I swear..."
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:33 PM
"ok will do" she waves and moves towards a other parts of the ship, maybe intent on playing with wussel(edited)
Marquis AlerionLast Wednesday at 11:34 PM
"It has a mind of it's own at times"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:35 PM
"maybe it just has a bad-luck crystal" she comments as she passes the corner

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:28 PM
((someone should novelize it -.-))
a while after the ship left.
some unsavory people can be seen scuffling about, a big brute says to his underlings:"SO y'ous 'elling MEh that's there were a RAInbow be spotted 'ere" to which the underling responds: "nah boss, a girll wearing a  frilly rain'bow" he pauses "yaknow duahter of such and foot or something, that big guy's brat" the brute ponders for a while: "maybE IT Be tha't". Such a eloquent conversation could be heard in the back-allies of the docks not long after the ship left and stories spread.

"I hope you are better"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Wednesday at 11:46 PM

"Good morning Vladislav, slept well?"
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:18 PM

Max IVLast Thursday at 8:18 PM

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:24 PM
"world map" she causally comments "i got bored with coloring the same old ship map so i though let's go bigger" she says as roughly about half the ship's maps in the halls are colored(see doc)(edited)

(ah ok)
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:25 PM
The seat is free. I say still reading.(edited)
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:25 PM
Arthur sits down
"Whatcha reading?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:25 PM
"So, slept well?"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:25 PM
I am reading: "The guide to railways."
A good read, besides I need to start working on some.
When I get back
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:26 PM
"Weren´t you here to rest and relax?"
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:27 PM
"Reading can be relaxing"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:27 PM
Yes, but the book is quite loosely related. It is more about history of the railways than anything.
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:27 PM
"hmm" she has a feeling some mechanized moles will make short work of those on the ship "i should proablly patch up any holes i find" she comments on her own thoughts
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:27 PM
"So what happened to your friend that brought you your crystal?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:28 PM
"So you are not as stressed as you were last night?"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:28 PM
He went off to find some other adventures. He loves to travel.
I am not Maloy.
I had a good sleep.
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:28 PM
"Thats good to hear."
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:28 PM
"Oh, what where you stressed last night?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:29 PM
Arthur feels a small jab of an elbow to his side
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:29 PM
Nothing of importance to you.
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:29 PM
he looks to the side
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:30 PM
Maloy is looking the other direction
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:30 PM
"Say, Alicia, does luggage and cargo get checked before departure? Like, their contents?"
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:30 PM
"What do you want?" he says to maloy
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:31 PM
"A nice breakfast most likely, weren´t you about to tell us someething about this historic ship a few minutes ago?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:31 PM
"no?" she puts one side of a crayon to her chin "i don't think so, everyone is also not that familiar with the ship, soo... maybe some of it was already here from the ship's owners?" she shrugs "just carry a weapon, you'll be fine" she comments like its the most natural thing in the world(edited)
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:32 PM
arthur leans in and whispers"Not here"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:32 PM
I close the book and put it back in the inner pocket of my suit.
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:32 PM

"Well then, let´s get a waiter"
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
would tap the hilt of her knife in reflex
"Oh.. That might be how the monkey thing got on board then.."
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
he turns back to vlad "So, how did you get all of your money?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
claps twice " Waiter @Marquis Alerion"
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
"I know you are a good business man, but there has to be something else involved"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
Ahh. Long story short I sell processed oil in Ubergrad.
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
"don't forget the robotic woodworms"

It is actually a lot more complicated than that.
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:34 PM
"Are you making a fool out of me?" she pouts
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:34 PM
"And how did you start?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
"yeah.. no really a tiny machine, looks like it had someone controlling it, so it was not a person, too small for that you see, so some critter got smart and made a flying drill" she theorizes while drawing circles in the air(edited)
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
@Chancellor Lakkin "Yes sir?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
"Could you fetch me a breakfast? Scrambled eggs maybe?"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
@Marquis Alerion Where are my scrambled eggs? Are the chefs even working?
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
The scrambled eggs arrive on-point with your complaining
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
to the waiter "Could you bring me some Ham and eggs?"

Ah thank you! I say to the guy who gave me my meal.

A bang is heard from the decks
"What the"
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 10:56 PM
he pulls a small photograph from his wallet. He looks at it for more time than is perhaps reasonable, his eyes seem glassy and distant
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 10:57 PM
The crew abandons the game quick, rushing to the fire extinguishers

The lower sails suddenly burst into flames

the ship in the distance is still there, filled with many confused yaliseans

Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 10:04 PM
The ship stabilizes just over the water, occasionally breaching a particularly high wave
"Time to see if this works, then"
"Now where do we throw that from..."
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 10:05 PM
"hah... we might get slowed down even more with a net dragging behind us" she relised that it may take a while before they get there
"just use the middle of the deck, to bad we didn't have crates or something"
"also we take half the man and stretch it between two groups and go to the back and lower it down... that unless you want someone to be keelhauled" she references a old sea-bound profession where they would drag someone on the bottom of their ships, but the length not width as here would be the case
Alicia also makes sure to at least have some ends tied to the sturdy looking parts of the railing
"the idea is to have a sideways hang-mat!" she shouts at the crew, signaling that they should get the four ends of the net and have ropes extend from those to the ship's anchor points
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 10:11 PM
"Uuuuuuuuuh"
"Well, we could do that yeah"
"From the side it is"
"Let's measure that rope real quick"
They get the length
"A tad short but it should do the trick"
After some preparations the crew throws the netting overboard
(Nah)
(Unless you want to resolve the food situation)
(This will get everyone just enough to survive)
(But it won't be nice)

Alicia doesn't know if she should sneer at Huaten or yell at him to come help
she desides 'something' and contiues helping the rest of the crew make sure everybody doesn't starve

The man takes out a notebook, completely ignoring Alicia and begins writing in it

Dermont swings down the sails and balloons back to the deck and walks down the stairs
he hears music from downstairs and heads towards it
Dòna HexhamLast Friday at 10:50 PM
opon her way to the deck, Dòna noticed little crew were about. Wondering where they were, she reached the deck and saw many of them being busy with ropes. She would head back down
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 10:54 PM
Andrew walks across the deck on a quick stroll
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 10:54 PM

“Hello there, just going on a stroll”
“Everyone looks busy, is there a way I could help you out for a moment?”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 10:56 PM
"i notced, and you can" the normally smiling and cheery Alicia has a stern face, untypicly
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 10:57 PM
“Great, how may I be of use?”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 10:59 PM
"well... we're trying to scoop fish with a improvised net while keeping the sails steady, you can help the sails" she pauses "or you can think of something to make it so we get more fish in the net" noteing that you really can't help much outside of maintaining what is happeing
Alicia peers ove rthe edge to see what is in the net at this moment @Marquis Alerion 
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:00 PM
Andrew takes a rope of the sails and keeps it straight.
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:00 PM
Not much right now
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:00 PM

A few loose fish and one very, very lost pelican
It's drowning
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:01 PM
“Even though I am a passenger, I’m always willing to help. If you need an extra hand, I’m there!”
he yells down from the rigging of the sails
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:05 PM
"i apologise for the sunk holiday you were supposed to have on this 'quaint' voyage" she shouts back, somewhere her tone indicates that it doesn't really bother her but things happen 'the cheery kidlike Alicia seems far away'

“It’s alright, what’s life without an adventure once in a while!?” he shouts down

[the underworld is restless, and as rumors of a certain someone being on a ship permute the back alleys a old nondescript ship leaves from a "dark" dock section, it was a proud battleship in its heyday but now it's a tattered old gnarled ship with flaking paint and a crew that can be said to more filth than men, it sets sail following the route of the holiday ship]

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:12 PM
"and drag down the net so everything we cuaght can get out?" she looks somewhat unamused
"we need a schoop..." she ponders "i think we can do something like that but it will be minimal"

hands the rope to a sailor
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:13 PM
"the ropes are short and we can't get it much deeper, but you're free to try"

he looks around the deck

Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:14 PM
he finds a piece of metal with a loop on it
“This could possibly work...”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:16 PM
she raises a eyebrow
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:16 PM
he hauls the piece back up and manages to tie one of the ropes around the loop, freeing one sailor to do other things
Andrew comes down from the rigging
“That’s one less sailor having to hold a rope.”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:20 PM
"yeah except he was supposed to pull it in after we got more than just a bird and some small fries, also... you do relise we used the strongest looking part of the ship's raling to hold it behind, it's steel afterall" she explains in dry voice
"think fulcrum" she lets out a complicated word, 'i want the happy child back' the autor thinks
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:22 PM
Andrew ponders the word for a moment
in this moment he remembers learning about levers, “but what part was the fulcrum” he thinks
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:23 PM
"well we can only wait untill the net gets something, too bad it's shallow as can be"
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:24 PM
“Yeah, what’s it made out of?”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:24 PM
"ah..." she had a dangerous idea
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:24 PM
“If you could somehow make it bigger...”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:26 PM
"the net is just the baloon's rigging" she walks off towards the armoury "DON'T SLACK OFF YOU, and reel it in if it looks filled for a third" she shouts at the men manning the net "i have abetter idea, but it may be a bit wastefull and involves more explsions"
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:27 PM
Andrew climbs back up the rigging and with the help of a sailor, he unties the knot
the sailor then reluctantly takes the rope and returns to his job
Andrew goes back down to the deck and waits
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:37 PM

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:44 PM
the improv flies in a beutufull arc, drawing thin line of smoke behind it and lands the water a good while away where it quickly sinks, barely two seconds the explosive blasts open causing a loud bang/plop to happen as a result the fish and whatever may be lurking come rushing this way right into the net, after she doen the act she shouted at the men "GET REDDY!" not a moment later a surge and strain happend to the ropes holding the net to the ship, as it slows just a little
[the net is filled with a wriggling mass of fish(and a pelican) as the men struggle it to get it aboard]
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:44 PM
(His life is in your hands now)
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:45 PM
Andrew quickly removes the pelican
he gets it to spit out a bunch of water

 in the confucian Alicia slips something into her bag  before piping up to the crew "Remember who got it done" she stand proud and triomphant with one foot on the giant pile
Dòna HexhamLast Friday at 11:47 PM
the loud bang, followed by a lurch of the ship shook Dòna out of her chambers. She comes running onto the deck
"What the hell was that!"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:47 PM
"Big sis will never let everyone down!" she delcares
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:47 PM
Andrew quietly starts drying off the pelican
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:48 PM
the pelican seems increasingly confused
It is quite concussed from the bang, and one of his wings is... Obviously broken
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:49 PM
andrew puts the pelican on a warm bench to sun dry before running off
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:49 PM
The pelican trembles on the bench
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:49 PM
he will tend to him later
Dòna HexhamLast Friday at 11:49 PM
noticing Alicia and the crew's excitement, she calms down. Something good had happened for once
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:49 PM
the crew is ecstatic that they don't have to go hungry tonight even if it's only fish for a while, even though they still need to process the mass of fish they are cheering, a squid reaches for dona
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:50 PM
he comes back up with a blanket and drops it
he runs up to the squid tentacle and tries to stomp on it
(How do I use rpbot?)
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:51 PM
Alicia is happier again now that she won't need to go on a diet, last time was way too long and terrible
Dòna HexhamLast Friday at 11:52 PM
Dòna would notice the squid, and stomp on it quite angrily
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:52 PM
The squid is thoroughly flattened

"A MIRACLE"

"just make sure we can use it for a while, i may not be able to do that again" she pouts at the fact that she would like to
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:56 PM

Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:56 PM
"I will get to it right away! We still have some salt, I think"
"Days of smoked, fresh-caught fish!"
"Ah, smells like childhood"
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:56 PM
“Hey little buddy”

The pelican is now under a blanket

“Lemme see that wing...”

Noticing the fish, it CHARGES
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:57 PM
"we can make more, just scoop some water in a few dozen buckets and use the engine's or sun's heat to make the salt apear" she energeticly explains

Woah..!
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:57 PM
And flops on the ground before it could reach it's target
Confusion intensifies again
Why are the fish outside water?
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:57 PM
Andrew picks up the pelican and one of the smaller fish
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:58 PM
This is a question for wiser, older pelican
He is a hungry pelican
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:58 PM
he puts the pelican back on the blanket and gives it the fish
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:58 PM
He gulps it in one go

"the bird is totally stealling my lime-light" she mumbles, sighs and slumps to one side

Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 11:59 PM
"Congrats Alicia"
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:59 PM
“Oh, poor thing...”

The wing is missing a few vital feathers and it's tip is broken

a puzzled look appears on Dòna's face. "why are you caring for that bird, mister.."
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:00 AM
*he was caught in the net.”
“Poor thing”
“His wingtip is bent. If I’m gonna take care of him, I will need to make him a splint”
Dòna HexhamLast Saturday at 12:03 AM
"Can't the chef just.. Cook it?"
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:03 AM
“No, of course not!”
“See all the fish there, all of them are way tastier than any pelican”
Marquis AlerionLast Saturday at 12:05 AM
The Pelican looks at Dona, frightened
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:06 AM
Andrew picks him up and bundles him in a blanket

“This is why you always pack extra blankets...”

The Pelican looks at her leave
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:08 AM
Andrew takes the pelican burrito inside
he goes into the cargo hold
Marquis AlerionLast Saturday at 12:08 AM
The Pelican struggles... And fails
Dòna HexhamLast Saturday at 12:08 AM

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:12 AM
the crew start sorting the fish into spare crates most with a decent layer of salt, [this just in] the kitchen and stores is out of spare salt, but... well there will still be salt in the food just not much for anything else, the crew do this as they are taking precuation to not run out for as long as posible

Gashes on the planks remind you of yesterday's events
Mortimer is prancing around on deck

“It appears to have gone missing”
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:50 PM
"don't know, I'm just busy preparing for a fireworks show" she casually comments, probably something about coloring the skies as a celebration for the end of the journey "but shuss don't spread it around too much" she makes a note and contiues carring a few more things in, some smell like fish others alcholic just a tad bit
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 1:50 PM
You see Gunter Strom crossing you, going back to his cabin with a bag over his shoulder
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:52 PM

Marquis AlerionYesterday at 1:52 PM
He notices Dona and smiles
"Yeah, I'm getting back what's mine"
"Don't mind me"
He starts climbing the ladder to his cabin

M A D   L A S
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:11 PM
It's a 9, too
She's getting it

Akane FukumotoYesterday at 3:10 PM
at that moment a loud sound is heard
two interceptors arrive on either side of the ship
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:11 PM
And
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:11 PM
parts of the front ship start to fizz from either side and explode shortly after, the entire ship sakes and drops a few meters down as it just lost a part of its lift
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 3:12 PM
“What the hell”
Max IVYesterday at 3:12 PM
"What is that"
"Could you take me with you on your ships? Please"
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 3:12 PM
“It will be hard to board them”
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:12 PM
the front balloon just got seporated, somehwere inside Alicia 's huffs could be heard as the part, now become ship, starts to fly another direction

CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:13 PM
cackeling could be heard and you see Alicia stick half out of the window to fire a BLEU flare  and then a RED one fly over the ship

((Chancellor LakkinYesterday at 3:13 PM
((did alicia just bugger off with part of the ship
((Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:14 PM
((She did
((Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:14 PM
((Holy fuck
((And she did something else, too

CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:15 PM
in the distance from the direction of the sun a pirate flag could be spotted, Alicia flees the scene with new miniship

Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:15 PM
Three pirate-ships are rapidly approaching the scene, rising from beyond a nearby isle

Akane FukumotoYesterday at 3:15 PM
indicates to one of the ships
it flies close enough for us to jump aboard
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:16 PM
Dòna would come back on deck after having escaped the ballroom
PM Wilhelm JansenYesterday at 3:17 PM
The drone of propellers can be heard above the clouds.
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 3:17 PM
two RS marines grapple aboard to assist
Max IVYesterday at 3:18 PM
Arthur stumbles towards the ship
PM Wilhelm JansenYesterday at 3:19 PM
Jehrico sirens can be heard approaching from above(the ship)

Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:26 PM
Oh no
The ship is Ancient and Elegant
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:26 PM
Dòna would find a point defence
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:26 PM
It is weak to attacks
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 3:26 PM
directs the interceptors through the short range radio
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:26 PM
It switches the result to an 8
Thoroughly unprepared for combat, this ship
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:27 PM
Alicia's ship would fly towards the sun, away from the non-sense


Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:32 PM
Determined to protect the ship, she rnushes towards the closest point defence. She Finds a Gatling gun
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:32 PM
It's behind the ship
A pirate ship is closing in on the propeller
They fire grappling hooks to slow you down
You can hear their voices. They are after your riches. Your future
You can feel tihe genetics kicking in
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:34 PM
she proceeds to mutter a small prayer in another language as she loads up the Gatling with surprising ease, as if done a hundreds of times before
and with a final shout, filled with rage, and unusually intimidating for a young girl, she. Unleashes hell
"GAT FUCKIN BLEEEEEEEEESSS! "
PM Wilhelm JansenYesterday at 3:35 PM
Small biplanes dive from the clouds, Jehrico sirens wail and machineguns rattle as they strafe the pirates.
Sofia I Blomqvist av SvejårlandYesterday at 3:35 PM
(Ew Gat)
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:36 PM
The pirate ship behind you gets shredded in holy fire
Granting you a holy +1
You can feel your ancestors smiling upon you
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:36 PM
meanwhile on the mini-ship, Alicia sails away at a breezy ~100kph and at 400m or so high, getting away from the zealot, everything inside turned into visually violent colors, the purple hurts
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:36 PM
You hit a 9 on the wager, giving you the bonus "Watchful crew" as the grapeshot cannons start firing in turn
The pirate ships fall into the sea with the combined fires of Ingrami, Rising Sun and, now, Wolven might
In the distance, you see the Ingrami isle appear
Almost there
Max IVYesterday at 3:40 PM
"Can you tell your ships to follow the little balloon ship?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:41 PM
you'd swear you feel a angry glare comming from it, perhaps the seafood-only diet
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:42 PM
Dòna operates the Gatling gun, usually requiring a crew of two-three, just as efficiently on her own
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 3:42 PM
orders one of the interceptors to chase it

PM Wilhelm JansenYesterday at 3:44 PM
The planes split into two groups, the smaller one follows the balloon.
The larger group circles the ship menacingly.
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:45 PM
Alicia prepares to line up a molotove on a catapult made from panties in one of the windows

Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:47 PM
with the nearby pirates dealt with, Dòna stops cranking the Gatling. She shouts many a insults down at the crashing wrecks
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:52 PM
Alicia is out of Gatling range I imagine

PM Wilhelm JansenYesterday at 4:03 PM
The chimneys on the other side of the Cambek cast smog over the wide electrically lit avenues near the passenger docks.
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 4:03 PM
as despirate as she is, she starts throwing together to make a pimitive suspedium jetpack, though it only would slow your fall enough to not break stuff and maybe float like a dead suspdium miner, though.. not actually dead. as the ship is full of junk any shots would maybe set some booze on fire but not much else eccept pop the chaimbers or airholes in some places out of range from anyone standing inside

Marquis AlerionYesterday at 4:13 PM
The balloon creaks dangerously, Ancient and Elegant doesn't mean much at sea.

CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 4:23 PM
the ship Alicia was on exploded, because gunfire does that, but not before a crate with something attached to it blasted off from one side of it, something of a arc was seen and there may have been something resembling the twinkling of a star at that direction

CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 4:32 PM
somewhere off the coast of a island a crate with a girl on it washed up at a the beach, Alicia Usagi of the Devil's rabbit foot pirates rolled over and next to the crate, after catching her breath, righting a few bones, straitening what remains from her dress she pulls the crate on land a bit before opening it and looking what's inside it

Marquis AlerionYesterday at 4:35 PM
Golden light comes out and illuminates her face
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 4:36 PM
"what the..."

CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 4:40 PM
and there the story ends, Alicia gained a thing, a thing that she could not recognize nor immediately find out what it did. Later she would shoot the last flare, a GREEN one, to signal some pirates to come and get her, to which they did a short while later. using her name as the Seven Colored Demon to commandeer the ship and make her way home.
