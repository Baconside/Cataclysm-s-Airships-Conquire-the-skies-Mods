_At the coast strange creature-like metallic plants can be seen floating in the water, they don't seem 
to do a lot but sit there, at first some sailors get close to them, after one unfortunate person steps 
onto one it springs and the man gets reduced to pulp in a flytrap-like mouth. after retreating and observing 
them three things can be concluded: 

first, they grow slowly by themselves, it is due to this confirmed that their nature is plant-like.
second, the thing that took a mans life grew slightly faster, maybe something works as fertelizer.
third, unless poked they stay still and bob gently with the waves holding on to each other with, very 
slow, moving roots creating a floating flower field with a metallic sheen._

_After prodding and ripping off one of the things(A new species,  from the edge of the group, and causing 
the rest of them to start spouting a water cannon-like steam at the ships. It proves mostly ineffective 
except for maybe washing the ship and almost a crewmen off-board.

A analysis of the plant postmortem results in a few interesting things, it is mostly composed out of 
sodium, magnesium and to a lesser extend potassium metals, that if separated allows for the use of 
'Greek fire' weapons, meaning metal dust that on contact with moisture violently reacts and causes a 
fire, deadly if mixed in with weapons that start a initial fire and if water is poured on it... well, 
more fire and potentially explosions.

Its roots seem to grow sulfur crystals, it goes without saying that brimstone is good for fertilizer or 
gunpowder. though after removal of the crystals the root became much more agile and grabbed a researcher 
before the root got cut off, only causing a few bruises and nightmares.

while the leaves of the 'plant' mostly contain the aforementioned metals, the main body contains a 
bigger mix of them, tiny amounts of aluminum, some carbon and boron, and trace amounts of other 
metals such as iron, copper and rarely unstable elements is also found._
