A giant jellyfish can be seen at the horizon, ephemeral and delicate in appearance it floats there 
and towards the shore, a faint glow can be seen from the center where a grapevine-like structure can 
be seen. fishermen are complaining about the silent floating construct towards the local officials.

_The giant jelly floats there, seemingly in a different passing of time. Despite parts of it being 
transparent it's wholly made of lightweight metal, threads of suspendium can been to be interwoven 
into the structure as the primary means to keep it aloft. It's a pretty sight to behold as it floats 
and dances in the wind._
