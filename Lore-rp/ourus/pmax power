_the ground shakes once, back at the church the priests there also gathered in a circle to pray, all of `Seakan` felt the quake, then silence fell, clouds parted and something that felt like a invisible sledgehammer could be felt by everything in the country, this was but a side effect. it all flew around the supernatural shadow god, a absolute entropic force was exerted on every single spot inside the space affected, in those spots the entropic end of the universe could be felt, matter fell apart and decomposed at a fundamental level and become free electrons, neutrons and protons and even those dissolved into the base parts. Leptons, Quarks, the four forces fell apart and were reduced to pure primal parts.

quite alarmed by the many trillion years of sudden degeneration of the space around it. all the divine senses of the shadow god went full tilt, if it stayed it would also be reduced to nothing._
