Max IVLast Thursday at 7:33 PM
"You know a lot about the passengers, right?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 7:34 PM
"enough to know that there might be some problems" she settled on something resemeling a maid outfit "also there are other things on board to that are doing things" she looks at herself in the mirror to see if meshes well, as usuall everything is very bright and colorfull
Max IVLast Thursday at 7:34 PM

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 7:39 PM
"not personally" she pouts and puts a index finger on her lip "but i like how he likes to wear prety things and he's cheery like me!"
Max IVLast Thursday at 7:39 PM
"Yes, he is very excentric"
"What do you know about Vlad? Other than he likes to wear pretty things and being cheery?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 7:41 PM
"that his prety things are valuable" she says with a smile, and starts walking towards the deck "honestly i would like to get more done, barely got to know anyone here" she sighs
Max IVLast Thursday at 7:42 PM
"The crystal on his cane looks valuable"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 7:44 PM
"well obiously" she shrugs "he probally made big money with something" she opens the door to the crew quaters "my dad is also like that, 'LETS MAKE A HOARD' he says while sitting on a throne and looking at shiny things"
she leaves and walks towards the #windswept-decks 
Max IVLast Thursday at 7:45 PM

Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:03 PM

Hello?
Is there perhaps any breakfast for the hungrier of guests?
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:05 PM
"Of course, the chef is currently fighting with the eggs, I believe"
"What would you desire?"
"I will pass your order along"

Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:05 PM
I want some good and simple scrambled eggs.
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:06 PM
Samuel Munsbeck walks to the kitchens and grabs a few crew to make them play the role of waiter for the morning
"Tea, coffee, champagne?"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:07 PM
Some tea would be nice.
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:07 PM

Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:07 PM
I sit down at the closest table to me.
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 8:08 PM
Harold enters wearing a grey woollen jumper and a pair of well worn walking boots.
He looks shaken.
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:08 PM
He nods
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:08 PM
"What kind of breakfast do you serve?" she asks with an innocent smile
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:08 PM
"Most kinds"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:08 PM
Good morning!
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:08 PM
"We serve to the tastes of the three continents"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:08 PM
"morning!" she winks and waves
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:08 PM
"Sweet, savory, fishy"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:09 PM
I pull out a book from my inner pocket. It is very small and I start to read.
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:09 PM
"The chef is svejari and insists on preparing some smoked fish preparations"
"But we also have boarded with a selection of pastries, breads, eggs and salted meats"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:09 PM
"hmm.."she truns around to the counter
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 8:09 PM

Out of the corner of his eye Samuel sees a guest leaving
"Sir, please, wait"
"How are your injuries?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:11 PM
looks over seeing as she just left before something wild happen last night
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:12 PM
@PM Wilhelm Jansen
(You are the one Samuel inquired about)
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 8:12 PM
(I am aware)
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:12 PM
"Can I have some pastries? Toast with jerky and honey? A bowl of porridge? Some of that smoked fish? And an apple?"
she drones quite the shopping list(edited)
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 8:12 PM
(He's scared shitless RN)
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:13 PM
(He'll start following you unless you wager to lose him)
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:13 PM
"Oh, please?"
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 8:13 PM
(odds in pm?)
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:13 PM
You notice the man you were talking to quickly leave, motioning to someone else in the crew
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:13 PM
arthur enters and looks around
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:14 PM
"he must have better things to do" before looking at the menu "can i order the continental, sweet" a little uncaring at the atmosphere in the room(edited)
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:14 PM
The new waiter arrives and tells you that your order is accepted, although they do not have any porridge
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:15 PM
Arthur walks to Vlad´s table "Is this seat taken?"
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:15 PM
sighs "alright! It'll do"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:16 PM
Maloy enters the dining room,  looking for arthur
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:16 PM
"The continental it is"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:16 PM

Max IVLast Thursday at 8:17 PM
( @Lukas ɪɪ of Ubergrad )
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:17 PM
he sits down next to the seat Arthur seems interested in
"Good morning Vladislav, slept well?"
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:18 PM
would sit down at a table, fidgeting in anticipation
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:18 PM
(wait for him to respond to me)
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:18 PM
(I don´t need his consent to sit down , if i didn´t ask for it taps temple )
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:19 PM
sits next to dona, confident and colorful, a pretty decoration flower, outwardly she looks proud for no reason(edited)

(ah ok)
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:22 PM
pulls out drawing materials from her hip-bag and starts working on a map while waiting for food with dona(edited)
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:22 PM
"Ooh, whatcha drawing there? "
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:24 PM
"world map" she causally comments "i got bored with coloring the same old ship map so i though let's go bigger" she says as roughly about half the ship's maps in the halls are colored(see doc)(edited)
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:24 PM
(ah ok)
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:25 PM
The seat is free. I say still reading.(edited)
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:25 PM
Arthur sits down
"Whatcha reading?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:25 PM
"So, slept well?"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:25 PM
I am reading: "The guide to railways."
A good read, besides I need to start working on some.
When I get back
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:26 PM
"Weren´t you here to rest and relax?"
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:27 PM
"Reading can be relaxing"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:27 PM
Yes, but the book is quite loosely related. It is more about history of the railways than anything.
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:27 PM
"hmm" she has a feeling some mechanized moles will make short work of those on the ship "i should proablly patch up any holes i find" she comments on her own thoughts
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:27 PM
"So what happened to your friend that brought you your crystal?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:28 PM
"So you are not as stressed as you were last night?"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:28 PM
He went off to find some other adventures. He loves to travel.
I am not Maloy.
I had a good sleep.
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:28 PM
"Thats good to hear."
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:28 PM
"Oh, what where you stressed last night?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:29 PM
Arthur feels a small jab of an elbow to his side
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:29 PM
Nothing of importance to you.
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:29 PM
he looks to the side
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:30 PM
Maloy is looking the other direction
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:30 PM
"Say, Alicia, does luggage and cargo get checked before departure? Like, their contents?"
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:30 PM
"What do you want?" he says to maloy
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:31 PM
"A nice breakfast most likely, weren´t you about to tell us someething about this historic ship a few minutes ago?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:31 PM
"no?" she puts one side of a crayon to her chin "i don't think so, everyone is also not that familiar with the ship, soo... maybe some of it was already here from the ship's owners?" she shrugs "just carry a weapon, you'll be fine" she comments like its the most natural thing in the world(edited)
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:32 PM
arthur leans in and whispers"Not here"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:32 PM
I close the book and put it back in the inner pocket of my suit.
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:32 PM
nods
"Well then, let´s get a waiter"
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
would tap the hilt of her knife in reflex
"Oh.. That might be how the monkey thing got on board then.."
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
he turns back to vlad "So, how did you get all of your money?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
claps twice " Waiter @Marquis Alerion"
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
"I know you are a good business man, but there has to be something else involved"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
Ahh. Long story short I sell processed oil in Ubergrad.
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:33 PM
"don't forget the robotic woodworms"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:34 PM
I buy crude oil and sell the products.
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:34 PM
"that's also running around making holes, probablly"(edited)
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:34 PM
"Robotic.. Woodworms?" she ponders
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:34 PM
It is actually a lot more complicated than that.
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:34 PM
"Are you making a fool out of me?" she pouts
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:34 PM
"And how did you start?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
"yeah.. no really a tiny machine, looks like it had someone controlling it, so it was not a person, too small for that you see, so some critter got smart and made a flying drill" she theorizes while drawing circles in the air(edited)
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
@Chancellor Lakkin "Yes sir?"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
"Could you fetch me a breakfast? Scrambled eggs maybe?"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
@Marquis Alerion Where are my scrambled eggs? Are the chefs even working?
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
The scrambled eggs arrive on-point with your complaining
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
to the waiter "Could you bring me some Ham and eggs?"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:35 PM
I started as a mailman when I was young. I say to @Max IV(edited)
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:36 PM
Mortimer starts working double time
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:36 PM
"is that really possible?" She mutters
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:36 PM
"i don't lie"she puts her fist on her chest like a vow
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:36 PM
You notice that there are tiny bits of shell in your eggs, Maloy
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:36 PM
Ah thank you! I say to the guy who gave me my meal.
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:37 PM
"also it made a hole in command, so you can probally find unplaned holes on the ship somewhere" she thinks "well.. before i plug them that is"(edited)
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:37 PM
"Excuse my harsh words, but was Mortimer the one to cook this?"(edited)
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:38 PM
would look at the waiter expectantly, only to sllump as he doesn't stop at their table
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:38 PM
continues making a map, but by cutting out parts of colored paper and useing glue(edited)
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:38 PM

"Yes, yes he was"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:40 PM
"Is he drunk already?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:40 PM
"it's taking it's time though..."
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:40 PM
"I don't think he drinks much, sir"
Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:41 PM
"Then tell him to start, he should calm down his nerves a bit"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:41 PM
she speaks up a little "maybe he got anoyed that a animal stole his cheese? right dona, something went and stole something from the ktichen" she figured it out, acording to her(edited)
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 8:41 PM

"I..."

still not reading the atmosphere as ussual, a silly girl(edited)
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:43 PM
"Yeah! I caught it right as it was pushing this big wheel of cheese up the vents" spreads arms and draws a circle in the air
Elizabeth AshworthLast Thursday at 8:44 PM
Harlow arrives and takes a seat next to Sidlik
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:44 PM
"he likes his kitchen in order so something big must have happend"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:44 PM
Good morning. I belive we don't know eachother yet?
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:44 PM
"Looks like Vlad is popular.."
Max IVLast Thursday at 8:44 PM
"Why do you even have a cane Vlad, you don´t look like you need it"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:45 PM

"Hi im harlow" he turns to Vlad, and notices the jewel "Saaaay that's a nice jem you got there"

Chancellor LakkinLast Thursday at 8:46 PM
He follows Dent out of the dining hall
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 8:47 PM
Why are you here Harlow?
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:48 PM
puts up a heavy fake ubergrad accent
"I make diesel out of oil"

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:50 PM
"oh hai" she says while staring him once over "you ok?"
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 8:51 PM
He looks up, his eyes are baggy and bloodshot.
"I'm fine"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:52 PM
"terrible night?" she seems concerned for the first time anyone spotted her on the ship
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 8:53 PM
"The worst"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:53 PM
"oh, night terrors or the vents getting filled with fighting sounds?" she heard such a thing(edited)

"i'm guessing it's not from drinking the green fairy?" she references a strong alcoholic medicine some people like to drink that makes you see things
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 8:56 PM
"Sorry to hear that"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 8:56 PM
"have you not been sleeping for a while?" she chimes in

He gave it to me. I got it polished and put into a cane. I don't need the cane to walk, but it fits with my outfit.
Dòna HexhamLast Thursday at 9:04 PM
thinks for a second "oh, I read about them as a kid once. I was scared shirtless for a good few weeks, fearing the Gat shrine would sprout legs and destroy my home.."

"You killed him?!"
Elizabeth AshworthLast Thursday at 9:08 PM
"hmmmmmmm, so want to talk about politics?"
Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Thursday at 9:08 PM

Elizabeth AshworthLast Thursday at 9:40 PM
"also head waiter, do you know where Sofia is?"
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 9:40 PM
"I can probably ask our chef to cook some breakfast for you, madam"
"Sorry, but we may not disclose the location of any guests, as per company policy"
(And the fact that I have no idea)

finds a hole @YellowMiner (President Tungsten) made yesterday "dona look, a same one like in command!"(edited)
it's a round hole in a vent with sawdust on the floor around it(edited)
stares down it looking for clues on the owner that's not here, without results she says "do you think they made more holes?"(edited)
Akane FukumotoLast Thursday at 10:14 PM
"those look like wussul holes"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 10:14 PM

"huh, you'd think that yals would would think of something like that if they could make a tine machine to sit in" she goes the wrong way

"See, I told you it wasn't woodworms.."
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 10:17 PM
"who's to say they are not a empire of woodworms called yalis?" she holds on to the dream(edited)
Akane FukumotoLast Thursday at 10:17 PM

she hears and looks over from debating worms with dona "oh, you don't need to tidy stuff up, that's my job, technicly..." wonderfully slacking off as always(edited)

"well since i found another i guess i should go get something to repair the vent, it seems a grate is also knocked lose..." as she goes she comments "but what if it were the true story behind them?" pointless pondering ensues
Akane FukumotoLast Thursday at 10:21 PM
(is nobody going to notice the crate)
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 10:23 PM
(Alicia is not, she knows not to poke holes in other things, at least not where someone is watching, uncle told her that or something along those feelings)
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 10:25 PM

Alicia heads to the #windswept-decks to take a break and look at the curling that was planed(edited)

YellowMiner (President Tungsten)Last Thursday at 10:54 PM
the lower decks smell of smoke
somewhere in there, in some air duct, a wussul blew up, and in a spot well filled with holes, a small fire is rapidly growing

Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 11:26 PM
The gasses dissipate violently, making the flames easier to fight


Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 11:34 PM
As the flames dissipate you see Mortimer, crying
His mustache still sizzling slightly
He is holding a blackened egg and something that looks like a burned, fatty plank
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 11:36 PM
Alicia would come up from behind and pat his shoulder to attemt to ehm... make it less painfull, she hopes
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 11:38 PM
"WHYYYYYYYY"
Akane FukumotoLast Thursday at 11:38 PM
runs in and beelines to the RS crate
enters a combination and it unlocks
opens crate and takes something out
closes crate and runs back towards door
( @Cልፕልርረሃነጠ @Marquis Alerion wager to see this)
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 11:39 PM
walks over to the crate to see what's inside, or was
(wager stats?)
Akane FukumotoLast Thursday at 11:40 PM
(Can we say Mortimer was too distracted and doesnt have a good chance but Alicia does)
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 11:40 PM
(a chance at?)
Akane FukumotoLast Thursday at 11:40 PM
2-5 Alicia sees what the item is 6-8 Alicia sees an item, but not what it is 9-12 she sees nothing
(We can both use a trait)
(So they cancel out)
(So you know I got something out of the armoured crate)
(But not what it was)
(Not that that will matter soon)
What’s that again
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 11:43 PM
VI
In a wager "Nothing happens" cannot be a result
PM Wilhelm JansenLast Thursday at 11:43 PM
^^!
Akane FukumotoLast Thursday at 11:43 PM
Ah
Redo it but 2-5 is sees everything 6-8 is sees something and 9-12 is notices akane can open the crate
(That’s more than fair)
@Cልፕልርረሃነጠ
Marquis AlerionLast Thursday at 11:46 PM
(It's a bit tame but yes. I think Patosav should win more on a 9-12)
(Like noticing something about you)
(Not that you have any secrets to hide)
Akane FukumotoLast Thursday at 11:46 PM
9-12 we both notice something
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Thursday at 11:46 PM
(don't think any are actively visible that is not shown already)(edited)

(Fair?)
(You will be able to figure out what was in the crate anyway)

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 9:27 PM
Alicia comes back from sorting and bringing maps "did something come up?" she swapped some clothes so she doesn't look sooty from the fire anymore 'a woman needs to look proper' she thinks, though maybe it's not the best time for that particular thing or maybe her thing(edited)
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 9:32 PM
"Yep, something came up"
"get yourself to the balloon rigging, we're going to have to cut some of that net"
"Mortimer had an idea which might just work"
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 9:33 PM
"hoh, ok!" she comes along and helps, but somehow she feels uneasy

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 1:20 AM
Alicia goes into the crew section and walks with a spring in her step as she goes towards her crew quaters to get a good nights rest with a fully belly of home-made cooking
enters the sea of colors that is in her cabin and blocks the door from the inside with a painted carved totem like she normaly does when going to sleep, and plops down into a pile of scarfs as high as herself where each one hase it's own color or pattern(edited)

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 10:47 PM
sneaks out from her cabin where she spent a lot of time for not alot of reason

CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:10 AM
comandeers the kitchen to start making herself a nice but fishy meal, totally fitting in as a maid in the kitching if it was at some country manor of a wealth man or something like that, but she frying the fish! 'no-one can stop my wife-power!' she internally get's worked up and starts working on it(edited)
Marquis AlerionLast Saturday at 12:11 AM
Mortimer looks her way as he salts a massive number of fishes
"Huh"
the very trained chef does not seem to have anything to say
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:18 AM
Alicia makes a proper looking fish dish of a milder Ikan Asam Pedas with the whole fish even using its bones as part of the sauce, it substitutes some things with sea ingredients such as seaweed for veggies. 'but it's a fine meal!', 'right! ' 'yeah!'  went the inside of her head(edited)
again she worked herself up over nothing
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:28 AM
"hey Mortimer, i made a little too much..." she looks like she wants to keep the spare too but there is no such thing as a personal fridge in these days "so i think you can serve it, but i sorta want to have my time eating it" fury and fire went into the modfied spicy dish
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:28 AM

Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:30 AM
“Hello”
“What is it you just made?”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:32 AM
"i... i made fish dish, and a little too much... it's a mild Asam pedas  but with fish" she shy-ishly says
"mild-spicy stew" she adds(edited)

“Ah, if you made too much I would gladly have a serving”(edited)
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:35 AM
"oh-ok!" she jitters a little about before she comes with a platter of two helpings one for her and Andrew the maid-like Alicia suddenly fits into the decor of a proper servant, if not for the multiple violent colors she sports(edited)
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:35 AM
“And before you go...”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:35 AM
"hmm?"(edited)
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:35 AM
“Do you have any wooden skewers? I happen to need one.”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:36 AM
she looks around... and she finds a bag in the back of one of the cupboards before coming around the corner again "how many did you see?" she forgot to ask(edited)
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:37 AM
“Just one, please.”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:38 AM
she retuns with it placing it down next to the fork and spoon and sits down to eat her own meal "here you go!"(edited)
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:38 AM
“Thanks.”
Andrew enjoys the meal. He had never had anything like it
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:41 AM
she would enjoy her own food as well, despite having to modify the recipe on a already modified less spicy and more sweeter one than the normally spicy -sour dish it is "ift' gud youknow" she says while not minding that she is eating more hastily and less refined than she normally would, or maybe she always eats like that and it's just now that she stopped doing that, who can tell, but maybe that's how it goes at her families place(edited)
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:44 AM
Andrew leaves a generous tip at his table before leaving
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:44 AM
the dining hall is relitvely quiet, most crew are busing themselfs with food preservation after all
"oh you're leaving?" she looks at you as you go(edited)
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:45 AM
“Yep, I really enjoyed the meal.”
“He stops”
“You remember the pelican stuck in the net, right?”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:47 AM
"ah yeah the bird, so unlucky you would think a he shatterd a mirror or something" she makes a rather unrelated remark about it
"broken bones, someone said?" she is still enjoying the last tastes of ther meal by scraping it with a dry cracker out of her bowl(edited)
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:48 AM
“Yes, his wingtip. That’s why I need the skewer.”
“I’m planning on finding some wire and making a splint”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:48 AM
"ah, i see" she thaught something dangerous again
ruffles and handcombs her hair for some lose ones and gives the very few strands that fall out ((she has longish hair, dyed in some places ofc))
"is this any good?" she offers(edited)
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 12:50 AM
“It’s pretty thin, But thanks for offering”
“You wouldn’t know where I could get some wire, would you?”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 12:52 AM
"ehm..." she thinks "i guess if  you had some spare cloth you could get some strands or maybe try the ship's supply store if there are some, i'm sure they have metal wire in there, or maybe ask Mortimer" she looks at the direction of the kitchen "there are some dishes that use ropes and wires to prepare"(edited)
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 1:03 AM
“Thanks you, I really mean it.”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 1:05 AM
"it's ok!" she smiles the way she usually does "no i'm off too, seeya later. i have a feeling it we will bump into each other again"
Nathanial WestonLast Saturday at 1:05 AM
Yeah, certainly! Andrew smiles before leaving
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Saturday at 1:05 AM
she pockets a part of the tip and leaves to tinker with her own devices, bouncing out the room

Alicia lines up the knife "close your mouth so you don't bite yourself" and quickly and somewhat messy-like singes the wound shut "now it's still not good at all! so don't get up and listen once for a goddamn time!" she is very forceful on that one(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 12:11 AM
he opens his eyes wide and lets out a loud scream  just to pass out from the pain a few seconds later(edited)
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:11 AM
dona has started seeing things that shouldn't be there
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 12:14 AM
Dòna looks around, as if following something with her eyes
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:15 AM
lays him down on the gently, gets some pillows for his back "too bad, you're in no condition to move, and i don't want to let the effort go to waste!" she guards him as he lays there until the time someone else who's not chasing fairies to help her bring him to his his cabin on a stretcher of some kind, though he may be out of it for the rest of the trip, regretably(edited)
"dona... dona!" she snaps her fingers at her "could you try to get a blanket... er two of them?" she looks at the effects of a hallucinogenic drink meant as drinkable medication at one point, somehow a hard smile is made at it(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 12:23 AM
after a few minutes Arthur starts to regain consciousness again
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:24 AM
you wake up with Alicia sitting next to you like a wife tending a sick husband
Max IVYesterday at 12:25 AM
"what happened?" arthur mumbles
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 12:26 AM
Dòna snaps.. Awake? "I- I'll see what I can find" and clumsily rushes off
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:26 AM
"nothing much, you passed out from getting closed up with fire" she looks away 'since that's all i had at that moment to save you'(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 12:26 AM
he looks down at his chest and (presumably) sees a large singed wound
"can we go somewhere safe?"

CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:29 AM
"you've got us..." oh yeah she went away in a half-sane state "you have me" she looks at the bloody knife "and how many people could possibly  want you dead?"
Max IVYesterday at 12:29 AM
"I don´t know"
he reaches into his pocket with his left hand and pulls out a multi tool
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:30 AM
"also you're still cut up on the inside"
she has a complicated smile
Max IVYesterday at 12:30 AM
he switches the multitool to a small knive and swings it around "Anyone that comes near me will get stabbed"
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 12:31 AM
after a while, Dòna gets back. Looking a bit more steady
Max IVYesterday at 12:32 AM
she sees arthur lying down next to alicia, holding a small multitool in his left hand
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:33 AM
"oh hey, he's on edge" she explains
Max IVYesterday at 12:33 AM
"hey dona, don´t come too close" he says quietly
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 12:34 AM
she waves around a white piece of cloth "I surrenduuur!" she jokingly says
Max IVYesterday at 12:35 AM
he chuckles
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:35 AM
"huh?" she doesn't get it but smiles all the same(edited)
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 12:36 AM
she hands Alicia the cloth, it my have been a piece of an apron
Max IVYesterday at 12:37 AM
"whats that?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:38 AM
"well in any regard, while it's nice to get food freshly made for you, i don't think you should keep sleeping in the kitchen, but for now just rest a little" she covers him a little with it, not touching his wound, but to keep him warm. she did rip off his clothes after all(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 12:38 AM
"can we go somewhere else now?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:39 AM
"it would be best if we get a stretcher, can't have you open up wounds on the inside by walking"(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 12:40 AM
"We can just use this piece of cloth, right?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:40 AM
"eh it may help..."
Max IVYesterday at 12:41 AM
"You and dona are strong, you can carry me"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 12:42 AM
A fourth of the ship just went up in shards while hitting a mountain
You are all thrown to the ground
You hear Beaumont's voice, falling
And a sickening crunch as he gets grabbed by an odd flying creature
You may have missed a thing or two
Max IVYesterday at 12:43 AM
arthur grimaces in pain as he is thrown to the side a bit
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 12:44 AM
Dòna screams as she falls to the floor
Max IVYesterday at 12:45 AM
"Whats happening?" he says scared
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:46 AM
steadies herself "getting attacked... And allot of the ship was I'll fitted for ramming"(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 12:47 AM
"Then we need to get out of here, but how?"
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 12:47 AM
the shock made Dòna sober up
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:47 AM
"It can't be helped"
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 12:48 AM
"Oh no! What was that?"
Max IVYesterday at 12:48 AM
"I need to get to my room"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:48 AM
helps him get up
Max IVYesterday at 12:49 AM
he slowly gets up with the help of alicia(edited)
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 12:49 AM
rushes of on her own
Max IVYesterday at 12:49 AM
"can you help me get to my room?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:50 AM
"I'll try" she support him the way
Max IVYesterday at 12:51 AM
they walk to #intimate-cabins(edited)

Max IVYesterday at 12:51 AM
with the help from alicia, arthur walks to his room
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:52 AM
opens the door for him seeing as he has one foot in the grave(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 12:53 AM
he stumbles over to the bed
he kneels down next to it and grabs something under it with his left hand
"where to now?"
he stands up and stumbles towards alicia again(edited)
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:55 AM
helps him again "somewhere more sturdy, but I need to know what's happening up there "
Max IVYesterday at 12:56 AM
"I´ll come with you"
they start walking towards the deck
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 12:58 AM
"Don't stick out too much ok" she reminds you that you have though luck
Max IVYesterday at 12:59 AM
"I´ll try"

Max IVYesterday at 1:35 AM
"I was talking to him, and .. and I said something about Fablel, then he just drank some darkdrop, put on a copper mask and tried to kill me"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:35 AM
comes walking after doing her things she needed to do and comes to sit with the rest, that is if there is still space "woah, it's a lot less stuffy in here!"
she approved of the upgrade
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 1:36 AM
she reaches for the bottle of whiskey, and pours another glass
she utters something in a strange language, before taking a swig
Max IVYesterday at 1:39 AM
"Now Dona"
"Why are you here?"
"I am here because I needed to steal a special gem"
"Now its your turn"
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 1:40 AM
"Why would it be here, of all places.." she looks at the bottle
she begins to sob. The entire cruise had been an overwhelming experience
"I.. Ran away.." she tells Arthur
Max IVYesterday at 1:43 AM
"From your family?"
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 1:43 AM
she nods
she takes another swig
Max IVYesterday at 1:44 AM
"Why did you run away?"
he downs his shot
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 1:45 AM
"They planned my life for me.. "
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 1:47 AM
"Yeah, you ain't the only one"
Max IVYesterday at 1:47 AM
"Oh, I´m sorry"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 1:47 AM
"People telling you who you are, what you can and can't be..."
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 1:48 AM
"I ran away.. To make a life of my own"
"Proving I didn't need them.. "
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:48 AM
nods at that, though not completely
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 1:48 AM
"..."
"So..."
"What now?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:49 AM
"So... Now that there are more unfortunate holes placed everywhere, and I mean absolutely everwhere, do any of you think we can have smooth sailing from now on?" she rattled, perhaps something in her is made of steel, or maybe she's that dence(edited)
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 1:49 AM
"We're an airship"
"We can probably handle a few holes"(edited)
"Although navigating with the holes pulling us left or right all the time is going to be hell"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:51 AM
"Well wood and ships we can fix, but..." 'it's the other stuff' she implied
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 1:51 AM
"Beaumont..."
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:52 AM
"Also stabby in the kitchen..."
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 1:52 AM
"What?"
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 1:53 AM
Dòna quietly finishes the drink, then doesn't bother refilling the glass, and puts the bottle to her mouth instead
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:53 AM
"Samuel... "(edited)
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 1:54 AM
crying ever so softly as she memorizes about home
Max IVYesterday at 1:54 AM
"He slashed me open real good"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:54 AM
pats and rubs dona on the back(edited)
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 1:59 AM
"I'll..."
"I'll go sleep now"
"Wake me up when this is over"
"Take whatever you want from the bar"
"Who cares anymore"
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 1:59 AM
"Thanks.. "
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:00 AM
"Don't mind if I do"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:00 AM
He rises, grabs his armchair and moves it to face towards a window
Max IVYesterday at 2:00 AM
"Hey, alicia, could you help me to the kitchen?"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:00 AM
He takes a small blanket from one of the sofas and puts it over himself(edited)
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 2:00 AM
grabs another two bottles
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:01 AM
"Sure thing though you may not like what you see" she gets up and helps him, still sober and alert for reasons, such as dodging death and black and gray paint(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 2:02 AM
he stands up and with the help of alicia they walk to #drama-kitchen
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 2:02 AM
"I'll be in my room.. "
she leaves the cigar hall, bottles in hand


Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:24 AM
"You have no idea how frightening silence is..."
"Speaking means I'm me"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:25 AM
"You're just feeling anemic, you need a rest an stake to eat" she declares
Max IVYesterday at 2:26 AM
"You still didn´t explain why you tried to kill me"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:26 AM
"You said you knew Fablel..."
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:26 AM
she did close the wounds...
Max IVYesterday at 2:26 AM
I didnt know him
I knew that this boat was his
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:26 AM
"That's... Not something people should know"
Max IVYesterday at 2:26 AM
I usually inform myself before I go onto missions
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:26 AM
"That's the kind of thing the person who wrote that message on the wall knows"
Max IVYesterday at 2:27 AM
The Luma message?
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:27 AM
"You couldn't possibly know that..."
Max IVYesterday at 2:27 AM
I have my sources
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:27 AM
"I don't understand"
Max IVYesterday at 2:27 AM
"Do you know Max?"
"The OSR leader"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:27 AM
"What of it?"
Max IVYesterday at 2:27 AM
"Well I might have saved his life"
"So I got promoted"
"I talked with him and he told me he dreams of the dreams of birds"
"And how he met Luma"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:28 AM
"..."
"That's... Impossible"
Max IVYesterday at 2:28 AM
"Is it?"
"Alicia can I have your knive?"
"He can´t survive, now that he knows this"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:30 AM
is thinking about where to dump the mask, she heard a parking lot opened up recently near the royal empire "oi don't go thinking dangerous stuff"
'thats my task' Alicia's mind echoes
Max IVYesterday at 2:31 AM
"Alicia give me the knive please?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:33 AM
Hmm... "you know that you'll not be any better than a murder killing someone that can't strike back?"
Max IVYesterday at 2:33 AM
"And what should I do?"
"He knows too much"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:34 AM
"I don't care anymore..."
"I'm already dead..."
Max IVYesterday at 2:34 AM
"Look, even he wants to die"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:34 AM
"Fight till a messy end... together, someone else could say the same about you too..."
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:34 AM
"I can't go outside anymore"
"It's over, she'll find me..."(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 2:35 AM
"You know, when Max told the story she didn´t seem so evil"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:36 AM
"She isn't evil. She saved me, long ago"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:36 AM
"Become bait to lure her out, you know that it ends here, it ends but Arthur you'll still have to face it someday because you know something"
Max IVYesterday at 2:36 AM
"I know basically nothing"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:36 AM
"But she does not... Do things like we do"
Max IVYesterday at 2:36 AM
"I know of her, not much more"
"What do you mean by that?"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:37 AM
"A name can hold as much power as a nation"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:37 AM
"She follows her own set of rules. She will hunt me down for saying those things..."
"She has that thing with secrets..."
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:38 AM
"But rather than a quick end right now, why don't you tell everything untill you drop as you said it yourself(edited)
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:38 AM
"And she can find me... I've been marked"
"It's part of the mask thing..."
"I honestly don't know anymore"
"Besides, I do not want to betray her"
"She..."
He smiles
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:39 AM
"Yes I get the 'im doomed' thing, but in the end..."
...
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:39 AM
"She is an angel"
Max IVYesterday at 2:39 AM
"An angel?"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:40 AM
He seems pretty fucking delusional
Max IVYesterday at 2:40 AM
"Does she have anything to do with darkdrop?"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:40 AM
"I don't know..."
"I'm just one of her many children..."
"I do not deserve to know these things..."
"And you do not deserve to know what I told you..."
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:42 AM
sighs "if this is truly necessary" reaches for the biggest meat cleaver and ties to the end of a pole "any last words on your final chapter" she waits
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:42 AM
"I wish I remembered..."(edited)
"I wish I remembered why I loved Vivian"
Max IVYesterday at 2:43 AM
"You .. you loved her?"
"Just so you know, it wasn´t me that killed her"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:44 AM
"Typical" she raises the hallbard cleaver and rams it down with all the mussle the girl has towards the neck(edited)
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:45 AM
Samuel's head rolls on the floor, a tear streaking accross his cheek
Max IVYesterday at 2:45 AM
arthur stares blankly
he looks around
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:47 AM
"I forgot to wear a hood, rats I'll never get a opportunity like this again" she mumbled softly before walking over to help Arthur get towards where he wanted to go
"Well that's at least something solved... Hey arty lets get you to a bed"
Max IVYesterday at 2:52 AM
"Yea, I need some rest"
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:53 AM
(I mean that's wager territory)
Max IVYesterday at 2:54 AM
(well what would you win?)
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:58 AM
(Seems ok)
(Maybe switch the 9-12 and the 6-8?)
(It seems more middlegroundy)
Max IVYesterday at 2:59 AM
(yea)
(i got 6)
(ouff)
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 3:01 AM
9-12: you retrieve it but fumble fumble iit goes out the ship and it lands somewhere below))
Also, maluses and bonuses
Max IVYesterday at 3:01 AM
(so what do we choose, I don´t care which one)
arthur tries to grab the mask as you are helping him up
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:09 AM
you managed to get it out of the bag but had to use a lot of force resulting in it violently comming undone from its binding, the shining mask starts rolling towards a hole made by a missing plank. There is no clank on the floor below as its missing. The mask lands below the ship
Max IVYesterday at 3:09 AM
"fuck"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:10 AM
Alicia blinks in amazement "maybe it's really cursed...."
Max IVYesterday at 3:11 AM
"Sorry, I just wanted it to study"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:14 AM
"So you had to do it here and now?" she reprimands and is slightly amused by the 'troublesome incarnate' mask of evil.(edited)
Max IVYesterday at 3:15 AM
"I didn´t think about it falling off"
"Let´s just go to bed, or I´ll fall asleep"
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 3:16 AM
"Fair enough"she would help him get to his bed and fall asleep herself in her own cabin
dam well tired of being a crutch, she thought


CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 1:55 PM
the formast section of the crew quaters has been commandeerd by Alicia and is stuffed with various crates
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 1:59 PM
arrives having followed alicia
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:00 PM
turns around, notices you "you... ehm looking for something?"
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 2:00 PM
looks around for crate
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:01 PM
everything in the commandeerd section is stacked, mostly
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 2:01 PM
“Yeah”
“The big armoured one”
“Is it here?”
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:02 PM
"i've metal boxes, if that's what you mean" she looks observingly, with a smile... 'is it a proper one?' maybe..(edited)
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 2:02 PM
“It should have a lock on it”
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:03 PM
shows you a small tin can filled with salt, it locks though it's not what you wanted "this?" she shakes it
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 2:03 PM
“No, it’s much bigger”
“Big enough to fit a person probably”
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:06 PM
"hmm..." she walks through the heap, looks around and digs a little, before rolling a huge metal barrel, big enough to fit a few people in, though it's suspicious how she could fit it through the door. "this one?" it's filled with drink though as you can hear from tapping it(edited)
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 2:06 PM
“No it’s a box shape”
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:06 PM
GODDAMNIT ALICIA SNATCHED THE BOOZE
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 2:07 PM
“How did you get that in here”(edited)
continues searching for the crate
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:07 PM
Alicia may be stalling "just... ehh, removed the wall.. temporarily." she stares off (*rolls and used old ship trait and battlescared debuff against it*)(edited)
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 2:08 PM
(If I keep looking will I find it?)
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:14 PM
(Sorry, busy, gimme a sec)
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:21 PM
you peer around the environment and boxes, crates and not-containers are littered everywhere some on stacks and alot of it is tied down, 'WHATS THIS, since when did this become the new #shadowy-cargo-bay!' but that's what it looks like now(edited)
Marquis AlerionYesterday at 2:37 PM
You know exactly what you are looking for, and it's nowhere to be seen
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:38 PM
Alicia took Akane for a loop, how mischievous, maybe her smile was a bit brighter seeing her not find what he was looking for(edited)
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 2:39 PM
(People always forget akane is a girl)
(Good point)
(She’s supposed to be a quiet woman)
(So you wouldn’t pay much attention to her most of the time
(Yeah)
CልፕልርረሃነጠYesterday at 2:51 PM
"it's not here, now shoo, shoo! i got a show to perform" she gently pushes you out the place shes' been working on, gently becuase musslemass and mastery of fullcum was the only thing that allowed her to get stuff stacked up as the were(edited)
she started boarding up the only entrence from the inside to the ship part, wacking some planks into place
