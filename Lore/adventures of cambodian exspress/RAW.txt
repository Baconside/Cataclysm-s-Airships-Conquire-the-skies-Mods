Lukas ɪɪ of UbergradLast Wednesday at 10:59 PM
As I walk out into the night I see clouds speeding past the flyiong ship. I look overboard and see the lands and waters below. I think and think, and slowly get carried away by the sight.
I check my secret notes I always keep to myself...
I quietly whiper what I wrote down in a hurry before the cruise.

a while after the ship left.

Such a eloquent conversation could be heard in the back-allies of the docks not long after the ship left and stories spread.

"Time to see if this works, then"
"Now where do we throw that from..."
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 10:05 PM
"hah... we might get slowed down even more with a net dragging behind us" she relised that it may take a while before they get there
"just use the middle of the deck, to bad we didn't have crates or something"
"also we take half the man and stretch it between two groups and go to the back and lower it down... that unless you want someone to be keelhauled" she references a old sea-bound profession where they would drag someone on the bottom of their ships, but the length not width as here would be the case
Alicia also makes sure to at least have some ends tied to the sturdy looking parts of the railing
"the idea is to have a sideways hang-mat!" she shouts at the crew, signaling that they should get the four ends of the net and have ropes extend from those to the ship's anchor points
Marquis AlerionLast Friday at 10:11 PM
"Uuuuuuuuuh"
"Well, we could do that yeah"
"From the side it is"
"Let's measure that rope real quick"
They get the length
"A tad short but it should do the trick"
After some preparations the crew throws the netting overboard
(Nah)
(Unless you want to resolve the food situation)
(This will get everyone just enough to survive)
(But it won't be nice)

"well... we're trying to scoop fish with a improvised net while keeping the sails steady, you can help the sails" she pauses "or you can think of something to make it so we get more fish in the net" noteing that you really can't help much outside of maintaining what is happeing
Alicia peers ove rthe edge to see what is in the net at this moment @Marquis Alerion

Andrew takes a rope of the sails and keeps it straight.

A few loose fish and one very, very lost pelican
It's drowning
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:01 PM
“Even though I am a passenger, I’m always willing to help. If you need an extra hand, I’m there!”
he yells down from the rigging of the sails
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:05 PM
"i apologise for the sunk holiday you were supposed to have on this 'quaint' voyage" she shouts back, somewhere her tone indicates that it doesn't really bother her but things happen 'the cheery kidlike Alicia seems far away'

[the underworld is restless, and as rumors of a certain someone being on a ship permute the back alleys a old nondescript ship leaves from a "dark" dock section, it was a proud battleship in its heyday but now it's a tattered old gnarled ship with flaking paint and a crew that can be said to more filth than men, it sets sail following the route of the holiday ship]

“This could possibly work...”

she raises a eyebrow
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:16 PM
he hauls the piece back up and manages to tie one of the ropes around the loop, freeing one sailor to do other things
Andrew comes down from the rigging
“That’s one less sailor having to hold a rope.”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:20 PM
"yeah except he was supposed to pull it in after we got more than just a bird and some small fries, also... you do relise we used the strongest looking part of the ship's raling to hold it behind, it's steel afterall" she explains in dry voice
"think fulcrum" she lets out a complicated word, 'i want the happy child back' the autor thinks
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:22 PM
Andrew ponders the word for a moment
in this moment he remembers learning about levers, “but what part was the fulcrum” he thinks
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:23 PM
"well we can only wait untill the net gets something, too bad it's shallow as can be"
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:24 PM

Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:24 PM
“If you could somehow make it bigger...”
CልፕልርረሃነጠLast Friday at 11:26 PM
"the net is just the baloon's rigging" she walks off towards the armoury "DON'T SLACK OFF YOU, and reel it in if it looks filled for a third" she shouts at the men manning the net "i have abetter idea, but it may be a bit wastefull and involves more explsions"
Nathanial WestonLast Friday at 11:27 PM
Andrew climbs back up the rigging and with the help of a sailor, he unties the knot
the sailor then reluctantly takes the rope and returns to his job
Andrew goes back down to the deck and waits

the improv flies in a beutufull arc, drawing thin line of smoke behind it and lands the water a good while away where it quickly sinks, barely two seconds the explosive blasts open causing a loud bang/plop to happen as a result the fish and whatever may be lurking come rushing this way right into the net, after she doen the act she shouted at the men "GET REDDY!" not a moment later a surge and strain happend to the ropes holding the net to the ship, as it slows just a little
[the net is filled with a wriggling mass of fish(and a pelican) as the men struggle it to get it aboard]

It is quite concussed from the bang, and one of his wings is... Obviously broken

he runs up to the squid tentacle and tries to stomp on it

"Can you tell your ships to follow the little balloon ship?"

you'd swear you feel a angry glare comming from it, perhaps the seafood-only diet
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:42 PM
Dòna operates the Gatling gun, usually requiring a crew of two-three, just as efficiently on her own
Akane FukumotoYesterday at 3:42 PM
orders one of the interceptors to chase it

PM Wilhelm JansenYesterday at 3:44 PM
The planes split into two groups, the smaller one follows the balloon.
The larger group circles the ship menacingly.

Alicia prepares to line up a molotove on a catapult made from panties in one of the windows

Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:47 PM
with the nearby pirates dealt with, Dòna stops cranking the Gatling. She shouts many a insults down at the crashing wrecks
Dòna HexhamYesterday at 3:52 PM
Alicia is out of Gatling range I imagine

PM Wilhelm JansenYesterday at 4:03 PM
The chimneys on the other side of the Cambek cast smog over the wide electrically lit avenues near the passenger docks.

as despirate as she is, she starts throwing together to make a pimitive suspedium jetpack, though it only would slow your fall enough to not break stuff and maybe float like a dead suspdium miner, though.. not actually dead. as the ship is full of junk any shots would maybe set some booze on fire but not much else eccept pop the chaimbers or airholes in some places out of range from anyone standing inside

The balloon creaks dangerously, Ancient and Elegant doesn't mean much at sea.

the ship Alicia was on exploded, because gunfire does that, but not before a crate with something attached to it blasted off from one side of it, something of a arc was seen and there may have been something resembling the twinkling of a star at that direction

somewhere off the coast of a island a crate with a girl on it washed up at a the beach, Alicia Usagi of the Devil's rabbit foot pirates rolled over and next to the crate, after catching her breath, righting a few bones, straitening what remains from her dress she pulls the crate on land a bit before opening it and looking what's inside it

Golden light comes out and illuminates her face

"what the..."

and there the story ends, Alicia gained a thing, a thing that she could not recognize nor immediately find out what it did. Later she would shoot the last flare, a GREEN one, to signal some pirates to come and get her, to which they did a short while later. using her name as the Seven Colored Demon to commandeer the ship and make her way home.
