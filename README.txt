Hello, 

please don't repost my mods as is without mentioning where it came from or who the author is.
i've put alot of effort into these and as such am kinda sad whenever just were to claim this
as thier own.

that said i don't mind if you edit it(and not just some small name edits here and there) and
reballance it or remove parts. or mash it into a pack.

also would really love it if you were to give me a heads-up, for me(to keep track of stuff)
and for you so i may help you when you've got questions or come across something odd or
unexpected that needs explaining, or maybe you're just trying to get into mods then i could
give you help.
