this mod provides you with the basic island pieces for making floating movable castles and fortresses and what not, but they can also be used to cover fortresses and buildings to make hill forts...

you are also provided with armour equivalents for these...

i've also gone to the effort of adding flora to the mod so now you can make your little orchard and your bushes all about the place and take them with you on your conquest.
