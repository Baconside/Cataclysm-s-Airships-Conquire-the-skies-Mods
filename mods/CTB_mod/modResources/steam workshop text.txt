a mod that seeks to eradicate tech, everyone gets a free education!

removes all tech restrictions on vanilla modules, and grants the tech based armour bonuses.
as a result this mod will level the playing ground when it comes to techs.

this has been a request so here it is.

mod is incompatible with mods that modifies the base armour types and modules that have tech restrictions, does not modify other mods until we can edit techs themselves(maybe).

a example of incompatability would be the "no build restrictions" mod that edits allot of the modules in the basegame while this one does the same. when using both it becomes a russian roulette of what modules pops up on top
