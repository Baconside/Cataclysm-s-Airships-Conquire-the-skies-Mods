for all those who hate landships, this mod disables all landships.

basically what it does is replaces all vanilla landships with empty nothings... and makes you not be able to build with tracks and legs*... 

i changed things here and there and this will make it so ai's wont make ANY landships modded or otherwise*...

i think i could over-write some mod's desighns but i'm not shure due to mod loading order is being hidden from sight...
if you want to clear the active ships from a save you may need to manually edit it or start a new one.

also this is the reason the mod exsists: http://steamcommunity.com/app/342560/discussions/0/365163686040856723/

*except if its mod that adds a new type of tracks or legs, i can't delete other's mods...

(i'm willing to let someone else take over this mod)
