		"en": "A very simple mod that does one thing: add more starting maps for campaign. \nMade whit abandon for game rules and preset notions of balance. \n \nWild lands have 50% more monsters \nGigantic maps have twice the amount of enemies on them and are larger than large \nTitanic maps are even bigger and are around the maximum what the game can handle \nWilderness maps have 50% reduced amount of empires and twice the number of monster nest \nDense maps have three times what normal maps have \nverses is one v. one, mano A mano \n \n(maps larger than large have a extreme load times(5 - 30 min) and tend to be unstable) \n(let me know if you want to see more variants) \n(also due to the amount of new starting ways on smaller resolutions(all of them until zark adds 1080p) you absolutely have to use a small GUI in the settings)"
