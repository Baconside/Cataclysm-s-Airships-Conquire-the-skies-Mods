A enhanced music mod 

this mod adds new sounds to the game during battle and in different screens
due to how the game works only one such mod can be used at one time and
as such if you have music for the mod(and by extension the game) or are a
modder that has their own music additions to the game I'm willing to make this
mod a general resource for anyone to use and add to the game and not be a
ass

(modder's note)
you can have more music by using module affinity if you want to add music
without affecting the same files, this mod however strives to mod the files
that can only be modded once.
