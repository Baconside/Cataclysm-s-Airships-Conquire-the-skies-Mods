MECHwolfSpiderNestCleared=As the final shot hits, the metal horror stops moving allowing your engineers to scavenge the metal parts.
MECHspiderNestAcid=After defeating the giant monstrosity of mad science we've been able to extract its acid ejector from it in once piece.
MECHspiderNestLegs=After thoroughly squishing the spider the legs were ripped off and studied, as a result we can now reproduce those, neat!
MECHspiderNestMspiders=after capturing the small robot spiderlings we were able to remake those for our own uses after a thorough study dissection, a lot of poking them to get a reaction out of them and systematically pulling them apart piece by piece.
