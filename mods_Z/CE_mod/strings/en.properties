mod_HELP_COMMERCE=Commerce
mod_desc_HELP_COMMERCE=In CE there are various modules, techs and local events that increase the income, they do this by giving a negative upkeep (or by increasing city income) and as a result are influenced by the game in the same way as other mechanics, but itQUOTEs not only the player that has a increase in funds.
mod_HELP_TECH=Hidden techs
mod_desc_HELP_TECH=In CE there are some techs that are locked by another tech or bonus, while you have the normal dependency (visible line) there is also the hidden requirement that is possible (that is not used by vanilla), it mostly made to hide parts or make it non-linear. This requires experimenting and testing to see what unlocks what (itQUOTEs intended). The entire tree is made so only though research it can be fully unlocked, starting a testgame on max tier will reveal them.

CE also adds Ruins, you can see these as sort of lootboxes/gambeling, results and the types are random and hidden, some cycle or reset after a while and are not always plain positive. ItQUOTEs however a way to get some things normally not obtained in tech or at the start of a game and includes some charge bonuses.

CLOCKWORKCleared=After pulverizing the last resistance of the living machine your engineers start to dismantle and extract components which they will reverse engineer to make similar modules for use in combat, and what canQUOTEt be used will be reused as this horror was much like a plant in extracting minerals from the ground.

RUINSCleared0=Nothing, your crew spend half a day searching but thereQUOTEs nothing to be found or gained. After cursing the bad luck your crew head elsewhere hoping that this was just a fluke.
RUINSCleared1=After investigating your expedition, your archaeologists uncover an ancient scroll that detail a practice that was used long ago. After bringing the findings back to your city, your scientists clue it together that it is a system of tracking trade, income and optimising supplies. You also find a nice stach of valuable old coins.
RUINSCleared2=You come across a village that seems to have been isolated from the world, itQUOTEs surroundings wild with mechanical beasts. They greet your crew with a large feast and they give you a parting gift. An ornate cup carved from a single crystal of suspendium the size of a human torso. You commend them on the craftsmen-ship, but you make sure to refrain from putting anything in it. Suspendium is poisonous after all.
RUINSCleared3=Stumbling into a hidden enclave, you find out that your crew are surrounded by enemy clockwork spiders backed by soldiers of a neighbouring state. it is unclear if this place was a staging ground for a invasion or a hideout for defectors, it matters not. What does matter is that after a brutal fight and a heavy loss of life, in the bloodbath you managed to capture a spider production facility with blueprints on how to make these nasty buggers.
RUINSCleared4=YouQUOTEve found a ruined city, long abandoned and left to the elements. After reaching the center you find various half destroyed foundries all in different states of producing sizeable and ornate cannons. It seems that there was an arms race to build the biggest and best cannon, but the sheer amount of rescources used left the populus starving. Your engineers replicate the process and after building a foundry of our own we are now able to produce imperial cannons.
RUINSCleared5=After securing the site your troops sift through the place, only to be ambushed by another one of those machines. It is eventually shot down and destroyed but not before causing loss of life and damage to your forces.
RUINSCleared6=It appears you have stumbled on a massive pirate ship. The ship appears to have crashed in a gorge too, which would explain why you found a considerable loot aboard as it went unseen for quite a while. The scene aboard is reminisced of pirate horror stories of cursed gold and witchcraft, but you have none of it and loot it all.
RUINSCleared7=You found nothing except for a seven pieces of eight, that you promptly put in your pocket.
RUINSCleared8=Your expedition finds tracks of old large scale human activity. Following this trail until you arrive at the base of the mountain where you find a weathered and overgrown entrance to a mine. As you enter the mine you notice the walls are covered from top to bottom in giant crystals. Following the cave leads deeper and deeper until you enter a giant cavernous section. The mountain be a dormant volcano and in front of you rivers of lava flow past. The lava flow has the blue tint of suspendium, where old suspendium constructs peacefully float around, with some carrying mining equipment. You decide to explore some more and find a large extensive building carved into the walls, where you find a short but sturdy old man sporting a massive beard wielding a hammer almost as big as himself. After some coaxing and bargaining with alcoholic beverages the man tells you he is a specialist in all things suspendium, but he refuses to tell why he is the only soul around. All you hear is him mumble about something too deep... Some drinks later you come to a agreement for him to become a teacher to your suspedium craftsmen and teach them all he knows in exchange for a easy life of luxury and parties.
RUINSCleared9=ITQUOTES A TRAP! Your crew realise too late that they have walked straight into a carefully planned scheme set up by your rivalling enemies. After a big mess, whether by ransom or collateral damage your administration and army managed to rack up quite a cost to your treasure in maintaining the operations surrounding this event, you even suspect some of your advisors to be in on this and to be conspiring against you.
RUINSCleared10=You have found a small deactivated clockwork horror. The kind of horror that normally is a city sized machine. Thanks to this golden opportunity you have been able to produce small constructs, self-control and auto-reload mechanisms for use in battle and for reducing the amount of "living" crew on your ships, in some cases down to zero.
RUINSCleared11=You accidentally ambush a group of civilian scientific explorers from another empire thinking it was a scout party of spies to scope out your city. Although you still detain them for further questioning, amoung thier possessions are a pair of ornate gilded tellescoops wich you promptly take and some journals about the landscape. They promise to no longer bother you from now on.
RUINSCleared12=One of your captains snaps, shouting something about a QUOTEdemon kingQUOTE comming closer and closer. They started tearing apart those who were in their way to outside, before getting subdued they managed to kill a navigator and severely injured others on the bridge. The crew were shaken and desert days later.
RUINSCleared13=The ship searching the area reports a bizarre sight. A forest that stretched out as far as the eye can see, where the trees were only stripped tree trunks with no branches. Unperturbed by the sight you order it all to be collected.
RUINSCleared14=After the battle your crew alert you of a giant old ship that juts out above the old ancient forest. The massive hulk is unheard of and is sized like a entire kingdom,. Rather, youQUOTEd wager, that it may be in fact have housed once such a thing. However itQUOTEs there for the picking so you order your men to set up a encampment to strip and loot the ship.
RUINSCleared15=A mountain. ThatQUOTEs is what you would describe the pile of worked stone in front of you. Who, What, When, or Why is not known but there a huge convenient stack of stone in front of you, unclaimed and ready for mining. Some of your men shudder thinking for what reason it was left there but you denounce their fears and set up a ship line to carry the stack upon stacks of stone back to be used elsewhere.
RUINSCleared16=Your explorers go missing and the search parties for them too. And then the search parties for the searching of those parties too. After a more direct approach with troops, you find a clan of zealot QUOTEHead Hunters.QUOTE After coaxing them with some money and the potential for new QUOTEclanQUOTE members you managed to recruit them as spies.They are first-rate in their abilities, seeming to have supernatural grace. Though afterwards it feels as though the amount of incomprehensible and sanity damaging events has increased in your empire.
RUINSCleared17=Your crew report on a small house half buried into a small hillside. As your crew approach the house it becomes clear that itQUOTEs too small for most if not all adults to enter it normally. A while passed after a nimble scout that was sent in came crawling back carrying a chest filled with valuables. Apparently there was a small human inside with strangely tinted skin and weird features. It looked friendly and appeared to be in a good mood. So much so, It gave them something to drink and eat. It seems they became friends oddly fast which lead to them leaving with a present saying that they could do whatever they wanted with it. While inspecting what was inside, you turn back and see that entire hill disappeared as if it never existed to begin with.
RUINSCleared18=As you send the rabbel that is your crew to scout the forest, sounds of shouting and marching come back. To your bafflement they seem more organized and capable. Asking what happened, They only answers that they got beaten up and trained. Curious to the cause that took less then half a day you have them lead you back to where that happened. Reluctantly they go, fear and terror can be seen in their eyes. Eventually a landed ship is seen. Outside resting on a chair of sorts, sits a old geezer. The old man looks build like a bear and brass prosthetics. After a chat and a stare-down, the man unabashedly proclaims to be a pirate and that he set your men straight. You ask if heQUOTEs interested in becoming a instructor. Sadly, he declines but does offer train your own instructors. You come to a agreement, much to the dismay of your crew. The instructor to-beQUOTEs are sent and spent a few weeks with the old pirate. After coming back they refuse to tell what happened but seem to have eyes like a dead fish when one asks.
RUINSCleared19=The exploration of the area yields nothing interesting except a few souvenirs, some fancy bones and trinkets. On the way back from the expedition youQUOTEre accosted by civilian merchants, who seem desperate to sell you their goods. Or so it seemed, as while you were gone and grounded by them, there were massive bombings all across your empire targeting your shipyards and factories. While your shipyards were safe due to your fleets, the surrounding areaQUOTEs were not so lucky.
RUINSCleared20=As a ship was scouting the terrain to look for oddities, A tornado formed right on top of them as they disturbed the air that was already in a delicate equilibrium. The ship that got sucked in returned a month later with more holes than ship. It seems the surviving crew had to adapt and learned a few new skills in keeping things together in more ways than one. After the ship got into a dock it fell apart and nothing but a pile of rubble was left after a apprentice mechanic decided to pull a plank out that QUOTElooked looseQUOTE.
RUINSCleared21=Right after the battle your ships go into alert again as they saw a giant dragon laying on the ground. The dragon that appeared to be bigger than any that had been recorded before, turned out to be a dead one. The imperial veterinarian concluded that the the creature had expired due to old age as the cause of death. deciding to not let something like this go to waste, the carcass is skinned and turned into armour.
RUINSCleared22=While scoping out the surroundings with a looking-glass a strange group of floating islands is spotted, all being nearly the same exact size. After investigating it turns out that the group is in fact a turtledove graveyard. While most of the meat has various states of advanced decay the shell is still good on a lot of them and as such is scavenged from there.
RUINSCleared23=Smoke appears to be rising on the horizon, it appears to be a smouldering wreckage of a ship. Onboard in a relatively untouched space your men find small crafts. As your engineers and scientist get to work reproducing them, you also have test flights with willing pilots with mixed results.
RUINSCleared24=A crashed machine is found. Not quite a ship, Not quite a aircraft the modularity of it intrigues your imperial engineers. The sample is studied and taken apart to be reproduced.
RUINSCleared25=Faintly shimmering in the sunlight a part of a airship is found. It appears to be a launch deck for a self-propelled missile like device. It looks like someone decided that mining equipment should fly at ships.
RUINSCleared26=Faintly shimmering in the sunlight a part of a airship is found. There appears to be a self-propelled missile like device stuck in it. It looks like someone decided that mining equipment should fly at ships. Whatever the case the modularity allows the engineers on site to easily extract it and reuse it as one would after a bayonet got broken off. Furthermore it seems the site, other than the ship piece, appears to be free of combat hinting at a solo attack.
RUINSCleared27=Smoke appears to be rising on the horizon, it appears to be a smouldering wreckage of a ship, onboard in a relatively untouched space your men find small crafts. As your engineers and scientist get to work reproducing them, you also have test flights with willing pilots with mixed results.
RUINSCleared28=A crashed machine is found, not quite a ship, not quite a aircraft the modularity of it intrigues your imperial engineers. The sample is studied and taken apart to be reproduced.
RUINSCleared29=At the end of battle, A expedition is sent and the wreckage is inspected. Suddenly a trap was tripped and the wreckage blew up. It appears only the unlucky conscripts that went in got blasted into shrapnel. A scientist who got caught in the shock-wave had a concussion and had a moment that one can describe as QUOTEa naked old man jumping up from a bath, shouting while running outsideQUOTE. Fervently he got to work making something that protects one against impacts, though after this the man wasnQUOTEt the same as he used to be.
RUINSCleared30=A beautiful elegant dance, a sea as though painting the entire world with glowing cyan, a endless repeating symmetry of dancing crystals and patterns. Inside this grinder of suspendium there stands a solemn tower. Your ships canQUOTEt get closer due to the overpowering force suspendium gives off, your forced to send in a group on foot with suspendium backpacks to drive away the almost fluid-like dust that surrounds the tower. As the men enter they are greeted with machines and technology of unknown and unimaginable purpose covering ever square inch, and still active despite their age. Making their way through until the top of the tower they find the owner, a frail old man who looks like he can die at any moment, sitting on a floating suspendium chair. Turning to his dumbfounded visitors and showing a grin, he started laughing, pressed a button on the chair that caused the entire tower to shake. Not losing a moments notice the invaders rushed back outside. There the cloud appeared to speed up, violently lashing out. Before long the entire world around the tower started to warp as though looking at a distorted image. Even the ships nearby were not spared. The spinning cloud and the faint howling of a the manQUOTEs laughter could be heard as the cloud flew away. What was left was analysed by the imperial scientists, sadly they could only scratch the surface of the strange technology. But they were able to reproduce the QUOTEworld twistingQUOTE to a lesser degree.
RUINSCleared31=ItQUOTEs early silent, your search parties find nothing of note. As you sit on your royal flagship lightning strikes nearby and shakes the ship, as a result a coin falls off the table and disappears between the cracks of the door before falling though gaps and holes in the ship down to the ground below. Elsewhere a peasant is hit with a coin that came flying from the sky, using the golden coin they started a adventure that let them to become a famous renowned local eventually becoming a lower nobel.
