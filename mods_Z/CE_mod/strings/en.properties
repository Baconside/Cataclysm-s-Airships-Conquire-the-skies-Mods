RUINSCleared0=Nothing, your men spend half a day searching but thereQUOTEs nothing to be found or gained. after cursing the bad luck your men head elsewhere hoping that this was just a fluke.
RUINSCleared1=After investigating your expedition archaeologist and socialist uncover ancient scroll that detail a practice that was used long ago, after bringing the findings back to your city, your wise men clue it together that it is a system of tracking trade, income and optimising supplies. You also find a nice stach of valuable old coins.
RUINSCleared2=You come across a village that seems to have been isolated from the world having itQUOTEs only path out and the skies that surround blocked by rampaging machine beast. they greet your men, there is a feast and they give you a parting gift. a ornate cup carved from a single crystal of suspendium the size of a human torso, you commend them on the craftsmen-ship in the cup, but you make sure to refrain from putting anything in it you intend to consumed or put in a situation that would make skin contact.
RUINSCleared3=Stumbling into a hidden enclave, you find out that your men are surrounded by enemy clockwork spiders backed by soldiers of a neighbouring state. it is unclear if this place was a staging ground for a invasion or a hideout for defectors, it matters not, what does matter is that brutal fighting broke out and after suffering heavy losses and sending in a few waves of troops that you managed to take it over. While you did lose allot of men in the bloodbath you managed to capture a spider production facility with blueprints on how to make these nasty buggers.
RUINSCleared4=YouQUOTEve found a city, most of the city seems to be reduced to rubble and has been that for what seems a few decades. after reaching the center you find various half destroyed foundries all showing different states in producing sizeable and ornate cannons. Most notable about the complex is that there seems to have been an arms race to build the biggest and best cannon, your engineers reconstruct the process and after building a foundry of our own we are now able to produce imperial cannons of our own.
RUINSCleared5=After securing the site your troops sift through the place, only to be ambushed by another one of those machines, it is eventually shot down and destroyed but not before causing loss of life and damage to your forces.
RUINSCleared6=It appears you have stumbled on a massive pirate ship, the ship appears to have crashed in a gorge too, which would explain why you found a considerable loot aboard as it went unseen for quite a while. The scene aboard is reminisced of pirate horror stories of cursed gold and witchcraft, but you have none of it and loot it all.
RUINSCleared7=You found nothing except for a seven pieces of eight, that you promptly put in your pocket.
RUINSCleared8=Your expedition finds tracks of old large scale human activity, you follow this trail until you arrive at a nearby mountain, at the base of the mountain you find a weathered and overgrown entrance to a mine. As you enter the mine you notice the walls are covered from top to bottom in giant crystals, following the cave leads deeper and deeper, until you enter a giant cavernous section you see something you never have before. the mountain is not just a mountain it appears to be a dormant volcano and in front of you rivers of lava flow past, some of those a different colour, that of suspendium, another thing that catches your eye is the fact that suspendium constructs peacefully float around. Around these streams there is capture and extraction equipment. You decide to explore some more and find a large extensive building carved into the walls, searing it all yields nothing until you find a short but sturdy old man sporting a massive beard wielding a hammer almost as big as himself, after some grunting and bargaining with alcoholic beverages the man tells you he is a specialist in all things suspendium, but he refuses to tell why is the only soul around all you hear is him mumble about something too deep... Some drinks later you come to a agreement for him to become a teacher to your suspedium craftsmen and teach them all he knows in exchange for a easy life of luxury and parties.
RUINSCleared9=ITQUOTES A TRAP! too late your crew realise that they have walked straight into a carefully planned scheme set up by your rivalling enemies. after a big mess, whether by ransom or collateral damage your administration and army managed to rack up quite a cost to your treasure in maintaining the operations surrounding this event, you even suspect some of your advisors to be in on this and to be conspiring against you.
RUINSCleared10=you have found a small deactivated clockwork horror, the kind of horror that normally is a city sized organism like machine, thanks to this golden opportunity you have been able to produce small constructs, self-control and auto-reload mechanisms for use in battle and for reducing the amount of "living" crew on your ships, in some cases down to zero.
RUINSCleared11=You accendentally ambush a group of scientific explorers from another empire thinking it was a scout party of spies to scope out your city, it was however just a bunch of civillians scientist. altough you still detain them for further questioning, amoung thier possessions are a pair of ornate gilded tellescoops wich you promptly take and oh yeah there are some journals about the landscape but they donQUOTEt bother you at this point.
RUINSCleared12=One of your captains snaps, shouting something about a QUOTEdemon kingQUOTE comming closer and closer, they started tearing apart the bridge that was in the way to outside, before getting subdued they managed to kill a navigator and severely injured others on the bridge. The crew were shaken and it took a while before they left the wilderness.
RUINSCleared13=after the ship searching the area flew for what felt for a long while it happens to come onto a bizarre sight, a forest that stretched out as far as the eye can see but what was weird was the fact that the trees were only stripped tree trunks with no branches, unperturbed by the sight you order it all to be collected.
RUINSCleared14=After the battle your men pear at the distance, there a giant old ship sticks head and shoulders above the old ancient forest, the massive hulk is unheard of and is sized like a entire kingdom, rather youQUOTEd wager that it may be in fact have housed once such a thing. However itQUOTEs there for the picking so you order your men to set up a encampment to retrieve all of it no matter how long it would take.
RUINSCleared15=A mountain, thatQUOTEs is what you would describe the pile of worked stone in front of you, who, what or why is not known but there a huge convenient stack of stone in front of you. Some of your men shudder thinking for what reason it was left there but you donQUOTEt care and set up a ship line to carry the stack upon stacks of stone back to be used.
RUINSCleared16=After the explorers go missing and the search parties for them too. And then the search parties for the searching of those parties too. something was found and it was a village in the middle of the woods, turns out it was the QUOTEvillage of the head-hunter clan of darknessQUOTE or so the locals said while standing next to a piles of heads. After coaxing them with some money and the potential for new QUOTEclanQUOTE members you managed to recruit them as spies, despite the nonsense they spout, they are first-rate in their abilities though afterwards it feels as though the amount of incomprehensible and sanity damaging events has increased in your empire.
RUINSCleared17=While looking around the place a solitary hill catches your gaze, on it a small house resides half buried into it, as your men approach the house it becomes clear that itQUOTEs too small for most if not all adults to enter it normally, a while passed after a scout was send in crawling he came back carrying a chest filled with valuables, apparently there was a small human inside with strangely tinted skin and weird features, it looked friendly and appeared to be in a good mood, so much in fact that it gave the man who came in something to drink and eat. It seems they became friends oddly fast which lead to a him leaving with a present saying that he could do whatever he wanted with it. While inspecting what was inside turning your backs to the hill for a while and after looking back the entire hill disappeared as if it never existed to begin with.
RUINSCleared18=As you send the rabbel that is your crew to scout the forest, sounds of shouting and marching come back. To your bafflement they seem more organized and capable, asking what happened you get the answer that the got beaten up and trained. Curious to the cause that not even took a third of a day you have them lead you back to where that happened. reluctantly they go, fear and terror can be seen in their eyes, there are also a few strange emotions mixed in among them. Eventually a landed ship is seen, outside resting on a chair of sorts, sits a old geezer. The scared old man looks build like a bear and has here and there artificial parts instead of what you would expect. After a chat and a stare-down, the man unabashedly proclaims to be a pirate and that he set your men straight. You ask if heQUOTEs interested in becoming a instructor, sadly he declines but does offer train someone else to do that instead. you come to a agreement, much to the dismay of your crew. The instructor to-beQUOTEs are send and spent a few weeks with the old pirate. After coming back they refuse to tell what happened but seem to have eyes like a dead fish when one asks.
RUINSCleared19=The exploration of the area yields nothing interesting except a few souvenirs, some fancy bones and trinkets. On the way back from the expedition youQUOTEre accosted by civilian merchants, who seem desperate to sell you stuff, or so it seems as, while you were delayed for a day and a half with having their ships drag you down, there were massive bombings all across your empire targeting your shipyards and factories. While your shipyards were safe due to your fleets it seems the surrounding areaQUOTEs were not so lucky.
RUINSCleared20=As a ship was scouting the terrain to look for oddities a tornado formed right on top of them as they disturbed the air that was already in a delicate equilibrium. the ship that got sucked in returned a month later with more holes than ship, it seems the surviving crew had to adapt and learned a few new skills in keeping things together in more ways than one. After the ship got into a dock it fell apart and nothing but a pile of rubble was left after a apprentice mechanic decided to pull a plank out that QUOTElooked looseQUOTE.
RUINSCleared21=Right after battle your ships get into alert again as they saw a giant dragon laying on the ground not too far away, the dragon that appeared to be bigger than any that had been recorded before, turned out to be a dead one. The imperial veterinarian concluded that the the creature had expired due to old age as the cause of death. deciding to not let something like this go to waste, the carcass is skinned and turned into armour.
RUINSCleared22=While scoping out the surroundings with a looking-glass a strange group of floating islands is spotted, odd in that they all appear to be of a similar size. after investigating it turns out that the group is in fact a turtledove graveyard, while most of the meat has various states of advanced decay the shell is still good on allot of them and as such is scavenged from there.
RUINSCleared23=Smoke appears to be rising on the horizon, it appears to be a smouldering wreckage of a ship, onboard in a relatively untouched space your men find small crafts. As your engineers and scientist get to work reproducing them, you also have test flights with willing pilots with mixed results.
RUINSCleared24=A crashed machine is found, not quite a ship, not quite a aircraft the modularity of it intrigues your imperial engineers. the sample is studied and taken apart to be reproduced.
RUINSCleared25=faintly shimmering in the sunlight a part of a airship is found, it appears to be a launch deck for a self-propelled missile like device. it looks like someone decided that mining equipment should fly at ships.
RUINSCleared26=faintly shimmering in the sunlight a part of a airship is found, there appears to be a self-propelled missile like device stuck in it, looks like someone decided that mining equipment should fly at ships. whatever the case the modularity allows the engineers on site to easily extract it and reuse it as one would after a bayonet got broken off. furthermore it seems the site, other than the ship piece, appears to be free of combat hinting at a solo attack.
RUINSCleared27=Smoke appears to be rising on the horizon, it appears to be a smouldering wreckage of a ship, onboard in a relatively untouched space your men find small crafts. As your engineers and scientist get to work reproducing them, you also have test flights with willing pilots with mixed results.
RUINSCleared28=A crashed machine is found, not quite a ship, not quite a aircraft the modularity of it intrigues your imperial engineers. the sample is studied and taken apart to be reproduced.
RUINSCleared29=At the end of battle after the enemy has been downed a expedition is sent and the wreckage is inspected. Suddenly something is tripped, maybe something snapped however what happened was that the wreckage blew up, it appears only the unlucky conscripts that went in got blasted into shrapnel, the scientist who got caught in the shock-wave had a concussion and had a moment that one can describe as QUOTEa naked old man jumping up from a bath, shouting while running outsideQUOTE. Fervently he got to work making something that protects one against impacts, though after this the man wasnQUOTEt the same as he used to be, people around him worry about it.
RUINSCleared30=A beautiful elegant dance, a sea as though painting the entire world with glowing cyan, a endless repeating symmetry of dancing crystals and patterns. Inside this grinder of suspendium there stands a solemn tower, as the ships canQUOTEt get closer due to the overpowering force suspendium gives off itself, a group is sent on foot with suspendium backpacks to drive away the almost fluid-like dust that surrounds the tower. as the men enter they are greeted with machines and technology of unknown and unimaginable purpose covering ever square inch, though it seems dusty the machines are all active. Making their way through until the top of the tower they find the owner, sitting on a floating chair, staring at a floating display made from suspendium. There sits a skinny and frail old man, looks as though he could die any moment. Turning to his dumbfounded visitors and showing a grin, then a smile and after started laughing, pressed a button on the chair that caused the entire tower to shake. Not loosing a moments notice the invaders stormed back outside. there the cloud appeared to speed up, get more violent and complexer. before long the entire world around the tower started to warp as though looking at a distorted image, even the ships nearby were not spared, then the spinning cloud started to rapidly rise while maintaining its patterns, the faint howling of a the manQUOTEs laughter could be heard as though echoing from everywhere. What was left was analysed by the imperial scientists, sadly they could only scratch the service of the what, why and how, but they were able to reproduce the QUOTEworld twistingQUOTE to a lesser degree.
RUINSCleared31=ItQUOTEs early silent, your search parties find nothing of note, as you sit on your royal flagship lightning strikes nearby and shakes the ship, as a result a coin falls off the table and disappears between the cracks of the door before falling though gaps and holes in the ship down to the ground below. Elsewhere a peasant is hit with a coin that came flying from the sky, using the golden coin they started a adventure that let them to become a famous renowned local eventually becoming a lower nobel.
