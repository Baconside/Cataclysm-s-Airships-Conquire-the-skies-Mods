		"en": "Adds more rams. And explosives.\n\nAnything you may want to ram with.\n\nAlso adds matching armours and shaping parts (slopes).\n\nAll products come in bronze, steel, and now copper and gold plated variants. Name plates included.\n\nSupports the ram charge bonus mod that was merged in the dep pack.\n\nAccording to some sources, the mines are now somewhat reliable now i tweaked them. Still, use at your own risk.\n\n\nFor the required speed, I recommend Turbofan Engines which can be found here :\n http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1198079954 \n\n\nBy YellowMiner"
