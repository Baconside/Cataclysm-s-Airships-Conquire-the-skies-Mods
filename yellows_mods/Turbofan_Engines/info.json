High power, good fuel efficiency, but expensive and explosive.\n\nComes in tiny, small, medium and large.\n\nThey are high bypass turbofans with the fan mounted at the rear of the turbine outside the ship, using the exterior of the ship as the bypass. This design fits well with how airships are constructed.\n\nAlso adds spare large propellers and turbofan engine fan you can carry outside your ship as decals.\n\nAlso include pod engines capable of sucking crew in and turning them in a fine red paste.\n\nNow includes jet fighters ; Heavy variant loosely based on sombrero's A-10 warthog.\n\nCoat of arms charges are built in the dependencies pack.\n\n\nthumbnail full resolution at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1369695407&fileuploadsuccess=1 \n\n\nBy YellowMiner\n\nAudio from freespecialeffects.co.uk",
