mod_desc_WUSSUL_RACK=The wussul torpedo was originally an attempt at sending RSI's wessel tech back where it came from. Since anything named wessel somehow becomes sentient and only obeyes RSI, they had to be made off brand. It is also commonly referred to as the wussul suppository, or wussupository.\n\nIt is a miniaturized torpedo equipped with a simple AI for target recognition and steering and a small front drill to make it's way through air vent grids, weak panelling and doors, cloth and other obstructions blocking it's way. It will seek and destroy enemy troops and sailors, entering ships and buildings if necessary.\n\nThey need to be ordered to board a target to launch.
